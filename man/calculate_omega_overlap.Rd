\title{function that computes the overlap of two feasibility domains}
\usage{
calculate_omega_overlap(A, B, raw = FALSE, nsamples = 1000, method = "sphere")
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{one interaction matrix}

\item{B}{another interaction matrix}

\item{raw}{TRUE: raw omega, FALSE: normalized omega}

\item{nsamples}{number of sampled points (for convex_hull and montecarlo methods)}

\item{method}{one of 'sphere', 'montecarlo', or 'convex_hull'}
}
\value{
the normalized feasibility of the intersection region
}
\description{
Three methods are available:
\itemize{
\item \code{"sphere"} (default): Uses multivariate normal integration via
\code{pmvnorm}. Constructs the 2n-dimensional constraint matrix
\eqn{C = [-A^{-1}; -B^{-1}]} and computes
\eqn{P(C r > 0)} where \eqn{r \sim N(0, I)}.
This is deterministic, symmetric, and avoids vertex enumeration entirely.
\item \code{"montecarlo"}: Samples uniformly on the unit sphere and checks
membership in both feasibility cones. Good for high dimensions (n > 15).
\item \code{"convex_hull"}: Legacy method using vertex enumeration and Qhull
convex hull computation. Kept for backward compatibility.
